I like the size of the book itself, I love the patterns which are providing new grist for the creativity mill. The instructions, both charted and written are clear and well thought out. I like that you can see both the right side as well as the wrong side. I guess that I like everything about this book.\\n\\nI'd love to see the same format with more 'regular' stitch works. I'm so pleased that I happened upon this book thanks to an Amazon recommendation in my email!\",\n          \"I'm a fairly experienced knitter of the one-color or color block intarsia vein, rather than a Fair Isle maestro, and what I loved best about this stitch guide is the multitude of reversible stitch patterns offered and shown reverse and obverse. If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.\\n\\nThis gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.\\n\\nThis also does not frustrate me in the ways too many other books and guides do.\\nHere, Leapman uses the symbols common in knitting magazines and most books on knitting you've seen. Yay!\\nOne of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches. Alice Starmore leaps to mind as a woman living in her own private Idaho filled with her own Runic symbols. I have to translate her every chart's cable squiggles into the symbols I'm more familiar with just to get the thing going. Gorgeous end results, but geez.\\n\\nThis is concise but full of options, so I FIND something nifty quickly and easily.\\nWhile I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.\\n\\nUntil that happens, this is my new go-to for fast, interesting ideas to enhance my knitting.\\n\\nThis is not a great resource for traditional knitting stitch patterns, such as gansey (guernsey), it's perhaps best for 'modern' classic knitting.\"\n        ],\n
